# neil-check [![Status](https://github.com/ndmitchell/neil-check/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ndmitchell/neil-check/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I regularly improve the `neil check` script to catch more invariants, and the `hlint` tool to catch more hints. This script runs the `git` versions of each of those against all the repos I test on Travis, every day, to catch failures related to those changes.

A multi-repo editing page can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/ndmitchell/neil-check/master/helper.html).
