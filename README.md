# neil-check [![Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ndmitchell/neil-check.svg?label=Status)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/neil-check)

I regularly improve the `neil check` script to catch more invariants, and the `hlint` tool to catch more hints. This script runs the `git` versions of each of those against all the repos I test on Travis, to catch failures related to those changes.

A multi-repo editing page can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/ndmitchell/neil-check/master/helper.html).
